# Accessibility

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Accessible design lets people of all abilities interact with, understand, and navigate our product.
{% endhint %}

Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone fully abled. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.

Here at our product, we comply with all levels of accessibility, to put it in a different words all people from anywhere on earth can access our website and make use of the services that we provide.

Our project is different than what exists in the market as it should provide more services, all in one product for different people with different special needs such as blind color people.

We have explained what colors, font types, and resources we will use in the [Mock-Ups section](https://eskandar-atrakchi.gitbook.io/team-project-proposal/mock-ups/icons).
